## How to add bootstrap navbar ??

` yarn add bootstrap , this command will add bootstrap 4.6 as current stable package,
now copy and paste bootstrap navbar from bootstrap website.
rename all class to className, you must add 'yarn add react-router-dom' to work with router navigation.
react router dom is very interesting things i found while i am learning.

rename all <a> tag to <Link> tag, and add like this
'<Link className="nav-link" to="/">Home</Link>'

this will work.
